This README.txt file contains information describing the files that come
within this zip file.

The zip file may contain some or all of the following (excluding this README):
1) the digital elevation model (DEM)
2) a projection file 
3) a metadata record
4) a DEM development report

1) The DEM is a raster grid: It is divided into discrete square cells of 
identical size that are tiled to spatially fill the grid region without gaps. 
The elevation value of each cell is derived from the values of individual 
elevation point data that lay within that cell's spatial coverage, or 
interpolated from the values of neighboring cells. Each cell elevation value 
thus defines an average or approximate elevation for the entire cell.

2) the projection file (prj) is a text file that specifies the projection, 
horizontal datum and units of the DEM. Where available, this information is also 
documented in the metadata file and/or DEM development report.

3) the metadata record (in xml and/or html) contains information about how the DEM 
was generated, its data sources, horizontal and vertical datums, etc. 

4) the DEM development report (pdf) contains more detail about how the DEM was 
built, its data sources, processing steps, etc.

Where available, the metadata record and/or DEM development report may be
downloaded separately.
